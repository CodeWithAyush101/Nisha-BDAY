        <h2>A Heartfelt Letter to Our Star 💌</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Nisha,</p>
            <p>Today, as the universe celebrates the day you graced this world, I want you to know how incredibly special you are. You're not just a colleague or a friend – you're a rare gem whose light touches everyone fortunate enough to know you.</p>
            
            <p>Your kindness isn't just surface-level politeness; it's a deep, genuine warmth that makes people feel seen and valued. When someone speaks to you, they feel like the most important person in the room. You listen with your whole heart, respond with wisdom beyond your years, and somehow always know exactly what to say to lift spirits.</p>
            
            <p>I've watched you turn ordinary workdays into adventures, transform stressful moments into opportunities for laughter, and create connections that feel like family. Your creativity doesn't just solve problems – it makes the world more beautiful, more colorful, more alive.</p>
            
            <p>But beyond your professional brilliance lies something even more precious: your ability to make people believe in themselves. You see potential in others that they can't see in themselves, and you nurture it with such gentle patience and genuine belief. That's not just talent – that's magic.</p>
            
            <p>On this special day, I wish you a year filled with the same joy you give to others multiplied a thousand times. May every sunrise bring you new reasons to smile, may every sunset wrap you in peace, and may every moment between be filled with the love and happiness you so generously share with the world.</p>
            
            <p>You deserve every beautiful thing this world has to offer, Nisha. Thank you for being exactly who you are – perfectly, wonderfully, beautifully you.</p>
            
            <p class="signature">With endless appreciation and love,<br>Someone whose life is brighter because you're in it 💖</p>
